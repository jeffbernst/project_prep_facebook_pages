prep_facebook_pages
===================

[This is an HTML and CSS project from the Viking Code School Prep Work](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-markup-and-coding/let-s-build-facebook).

Jeff Bernstein was here.

NOTE! There are two about pages because I redid it after getting a better understanding of how to set it up. I left both pages because the styles.css file is linked with index.html.
